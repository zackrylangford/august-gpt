The new Ford plant being built in Marshall, MI will be a $740 million investment from Ford Motor Company. This new plant will be the first new auto assembly plant to be built in Michigan in over three decades. The project will create 2,700 new jobs and will produce the Ford Bronco and Ford Ranger. The 1,700-acre plant is located in Calhoun County, near the intersection of I-94 and I-69, and will feature an advanced robotics-assisted assembly line. The plant is expected to be completed by 2023.
